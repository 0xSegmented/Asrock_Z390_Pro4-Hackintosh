SPECS:<br/>

AMD RX6900XT (Founders Edition)<br/>
WD-BLACK Nvme<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
INFO:<br/>
This EFI is made for a 8th or 9th gen CPU -F edition.<br/>
Make sure to create your own Serial<br/>
It is possible to update to Ventura(That's what I am on right now.)<br/>
<br/>
I RECOMMEND CREATING YOUR OWN! THIS WAY YOU GET EDUCATED AND WHEN YOU GET BUGS IT WONT BE HARD TO FIX!!<br/>
Downloading EFI folders that are not created by yourself can contain malicious files and can be very dangerous.<br/>
My EFI is clean, but better be safe then sorry!<br/>
